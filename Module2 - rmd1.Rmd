## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](https://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__. 

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package. 

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.

Here is an example of nested blockquote:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> > This text is nested.

``hi``

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption="Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y = g(X), g'' \geq 0$$

## Insert Images

Here is an image inserted

## Insert an Animated GIF and video

![sunstar](sunstar.gif)

![sunstar](sunstar.mp4)

## Insert text with some footnotes

Here is footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inline notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
